# Adzerk
## Typographic design, visual design, front end development
Adzerk is an ad–serving client based in Durham, N.C. They approached me to redesign their extensive brochure website. They had an in–house UX Engineer work on the wireframes then I worked on the more visual and development side of the project. I made typography the foundation of the design due to their large, and growing, archive of colorful content and voice. Their voice is unique, I wanted to capture that in the design, starting at the base level and grow from there. I developed the site on Wordpress and used various modern methods to speed up page load and optimize best for future browsers and devices. September 2012

# N.C. State College of Design
## Information architecture, wireframes, design, project manager
The College of Design at N.C. State approached Smashing Boxes to redesign and redevelop their main marketing site. They provided designs students had developed over a semester and a rough architecture of how they saw the site being used. Our aim was to develop seven versatile templates to be used across the whole site. Through a thorough content and architecture audit, I was able to make wireframes for each template. As I worked through the wireframes, the Creative Director worked on design of the index page. After sign off on the direction, I designed all inner pages. Halfway through the project, I took the mantle Project Manager, as our Project Manager had left the company. Developed designs were handed off in September 2012 and expected launch date of the site is unknown.

# ALMA
## Wireframes, Design
The African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA), a subcommittee of the World Health Organization, needed an iPad application for facilitating and easing communication between ALMA staff and African Prime Ministers & Ministers of Health. The goals were clearly defined. I wireframed while the developer, Leonel Galán, prototyped. The internal aim was to keep it as simple as possible using Apple UI Defaults because it was Leonel's first iOS application. As time progressed and we learned more, we developed the design and visual elements of the application. I worked very closely with Leonel discussing and planning the best possible solution as new requirements were discovered.

# Clinical Trials
## Planning, wireframes, design
Clinical Trial Results is an application that allows clinical trialists to enter failed clinical trial results. This is the only public repository of failed clinical trials in the world. I was tasked to map the workflow, wireframe every view, and design a modular system that would be expanded indefinitely. I developed a modular navigation that appends a tab as more features become available or as a user is assigned an additional role. The ease and accessibility of the forms are critical for inputting accurate information with relative ease; we worked with clinical trialists to design forms that would be best for their data input.

# Flying Saucer
## Planning, wireframes, design, animation, videography
I designed an iPhone application design for a local bar, The Flying Saucer, for my senior design project at N.C. State. Flying Saucer patrons have the opportunity to join a club where they quest to try 200 of the beers available. The existing interaction requires the patron stand at a kiosk—before or after sitting&emdash;and print a receipt of all beers they've enjoyed. They then choose their (maximum of) three beers for the night, print separate receipts for each beer, then hand them to the waitress when paying. This application aims to rectify that nuisance and obtrusion by placing the whole interaction in the patron's hand, while sitting, to be unobtrusive and integrated into the communal pub experience. This project was a semifinalist in the Adobe Design Achievement Awards in Mobile Design, 2011.

# Animations and videos
## Storytelling, animation, illustration, sound design
Over the past few years I've completed a variety of animations for a handful of organizations. While outside the exact "UX Design" discipline, I've found the storytelling and creation process insightful and useful to understanding the UX Design process. Animation has informed my designs, showing me the importance to step back and see the whole while focusing on details. My sketching, storyboarding, prototyping and collaboration skills all improved drastically and grew more critical to my thinking processes. It also taught me, happy accidents do exist, you just have to work for them.
