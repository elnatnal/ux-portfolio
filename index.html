              Stealz is (and will be) a location based, sharing coupon application on iOS and Android devices. I lead a small team of developers and another designer in mapping out and planning the application. After quite a few revisions, 50 sticky notes completed the architecture. After the architecture and flow was established, I wireframed out each view. The Creative Director used the wireframes to design two initial views and the identity system. I fleshed out the rest of the views and manipulating designs as development issues came up. Currently producing all the assets for iOS and Android OSes. &ensp;<span class="completed">January 2013 (expected)</span>

              The N.C. State College of Design approached us to redesign and redevelop their main marketing site. They provided us with designs students developed over a semester and a rough architecture of how they saw the site being used. We had to design seven templates to be used across the whole site. I did a more developed information architecture through a content audit and defining a loose content strategy. From there, I stepped into wireframing out the seven templates. The Creative Director worked on design of the main feel. From the front page I designed all the inner pages. &ensp;<span class="completed">September 2012</span>

              The African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA), a subcommittee of the WHO, needed an iPad application aimed at facilitating and easing communication between staff and African Prime Ministers/Ministers of Health. The goals were clearly defined. I wireframed and the developer, Leonel Gal√°n, prototyped. The internal aim was to keep it as simple as possible using Apple UI Defaults due to it being the Leonel's first iOS application. As time progressed, and Leonel learned more, we applied design and more visual elements to the app. As the application evolved, I worked very closely with Leonel discussing and planning the best possible solution via design and development. &ensp;<span class="completed">July 2012</span>

              Clinical Trial Results is an application for clinical trialists to enter failed clinical trial results. This is the only public repository of failed clinical trials in the world. I was tasked to map the workflow, wireframe every view, and design a modular system that would be expanded indefinitely. The modular navigation appends a new tab as the user is assigned an additional role. The forms are the most critical part of the system. Every form was given a large amount of time, testing for ease of use, expediency, and accuracy. &ensp;<span class="completed">July 2012</span>

              An iPhone application design for a local bar, The Flying Saucer, for my senior design project at university. Patrons of the bar have the opportunity to join a club where they quest to try 200 of the beers available. Currently, the interaction is obtrusive and an annoyance to the club members. They have to wait in a long line to see what beers they have previously had, pick out the beers they want for the night and print off little receipts to give to the waitress at the end of the night. This application aims to rectify that nuisance and obtrusion. This project was a semifinalist in the Adobe Design Achievement Awards in Mobile Design, 2011.&ensp;<span class="completed">May 2012</span>

              Over the past few years I've completed a variety of animations for a few organizations. While outside the exact UX Design field, I find the storytelling and process very useful to the UX Design process. The animation process has informed my design process, allowing me to step back and see the whole after focusing on details. It's taught not to lose sight of the full project when frustrations arise from little details. Happy accidents exist. &ensp;<span class="completed">Various dates</span>
